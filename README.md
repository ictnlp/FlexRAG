FlexRAG is a highly reproducible, easy-to-use, and high-performance RAG framework designed for both research and application scenarios. It supports **text**, **multimodal**, and **web-based** RAG, providing a **complete RAG pipeline and evaluation process**. With built-in **asynchronous** processing and **persistent caching**, it ensures efficiency and scalability. Easily load retrievers from Hugging Face and quickly build powerful RAG solutions out of the box.

# ‚ú® Key Features
- üéØ **High Reproducibility**: FlexRAG comes with a companion repository, [flexrag_examples](https://github.com/ictnlp/flexrag_examples), providing comprehensive reproduction cases for various RAG algorithms. Additionally, unified retrievers available on the HuggingFace Hub ensure easy replication of experimental results under the same environment.  
- ‚úÖ **Low Learning Curve**: Download and load retrievers from the HuggingFace Hub with a single command, eliminating complex setup processes. Moreover, FlexRAG offers carefully optimized default configurations, allowing you to achieve excellent performance right out of the box and streamlining the development process.  
- üåç **Diverse Application Scenarios**: FlexRAG supports not only text-based RAG but also multimodal and network-based RAG, enabling broad applications across different data types.  
- üß™ **Research-Oriented**: Provides a unified evaluation process for various RAG tasks, making it easy to test across different datasets. Official benchmark tests are also available for convenient comparison and reference.  
- ‚ö° **Superior Performance**: Leverages persistent caching and asynchronous functions to enhance high-performance RAG development.  
- üîÑ **End-to-End Support**: From document information extraction and segmentation to retrieval, generation, and evaluation of output quality, FlexRAG fully supports every stage of the RAG lifecycle.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Modular & Flexible Design**: With a lightweight modular architecture, FlexRAG accommodates multiple development modes, helping you quickly build customized RAG solutions.
